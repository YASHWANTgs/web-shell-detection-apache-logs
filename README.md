# web-shell-detection-apache-logs

The project is a mastery of web shell detection with forensic analysis of an Apache access log on a Linux web server. Attack simulation consisted of sending malicious HTTP GET  requests (e.g., GET /shell.php?cmd=whoami)  intended for remote command executions using a PHP web shell. thoroughly analyzing access.log patterns, the project finds evidence of exploitation as suspicious URL params, repeated access of suspicious files, as well as command executions attemptsâ€”key indicators mapping to MITRE ATT&CK T1505.003 (Web Shell). Analysis includes a step-by-step of screenshots of simulation of an attack, Suspicious requests (<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`), investigation of logs, as well as a handwritten detection process. This project exhibits key Blue Team skills of a threat huntig, an incident response specialist, as well as a log expert and is thus highly applicable to entry-level SOC analysts.
